The concept of employment is a step towards providing employment to the rural laborers as their means of livelihood. It is a pathetic attempt to provide day-to-day work to uneducated or less educated unskilled laborers in rural areas.
Today, agriculture as well as agribusiness needs a lot of labor, but it needs proper coordination! In today's digital age, it is a means of connecting the needy laborers in rural areas to the farmers or businessmen who have access to work using the new computer system.
Under the present circumstances, agricultural labor is sought only among strangers. With this new system, any laborer in Panchkrushi can be contacted and called for work and this will make the work easier for both the farm laborers and the farmers. Due to lack of education or lack of English in rural areas, the system is being made available in regional languages. ..... thank you .....",
